Assessment Tracking and Recording Templates - Guidance for Centres
NOCN have created a suite of templates that Centres may wish to use for tracking and recording
learner achievement and progression throughout their NOCN course. Use or amendment of the
NOCN documents is not mandatory, but centres must ensure that they use a suite of documents to
track and record learner achievement and that assessment decisions can be clearly recorded and
quality assured. This will support safe claims for certification.
Listed below are the templates that are available, along with suggestions about how, where and when
they could be used:
Unit Achievement Record
• Place in the front of a learner portfolio.
• List all units that the learner will be working towards – this will support both learner and
assessor/tutor as progression and achievements can be seen at a glance.
• Internal and External Quality Assurer will sign and date if the unit(s) have been sampled as
part of the quality assurance process. This will provide a clear audit trail of activity.
Learner Evidence Record
• This form would need to be populated with the assessment criteria of the unit(s) and placed
in the front of the portfolio, or in front of the learner’s work, that has been submitted for
assessment.
• Page number the learner evidence.
• State the page number where the evidence for each of the assessment criteria can be
located. Holistic assessment may be used.
• Includes an authenticity statement confirmation.
• Allows for a clear audit trail of assessment and quality assurance.
Unit Assessment and Feedback Form
• Place in front of each unit, or in the front of the portfolio.
• Record the summative feedback to the learner.
• The learner can provide their own comments in response to the feedback given, work
produced, what they have learned etc
• Tutor/Assessor confirms whether or not the unit has been achieved.
• Allows for a clear record of any action that may be required, which can then be signed off
once complete.
• Allows for a clear audit trail of assessment decisions and feedback.
Portfolio Feedback Form
• This form could be used on completion of the whole qualification/course and summarises
the units that have been completed and allows for the summative feedback to the learner to
be recorded.
• Assessor/Tutor confirms whether or not all units have been achieved. If not, then actions
can be detailed.
• Allows for a clear audit trail of assessment decisions and feedback.

Record of Observation
• This form could be used by the tutor/assessor to record the details of an observation of
learner activity or performance.
• The units and assessment criteria that have been covered by the assessment can be
recorded.
• Useful for holistic assessment, where there is an opportunity to assess across a range of
units or learning outcomes.
Witness Statement
• This form can be used by someone who is acting as a witness for the learner and as such,
will be observing a particular activity or aspect of performance, in place of the tutor/assessor.
• The assessor/tutor then details the assessment criteria for which the activity provides
evidence for.
Question and Answer Record
• This form may be used to record oral ‘Question and Answer’ with the learner.
• Allows the assessment criteria met to be recorded.
• Allows for a summary of feedback to be documented.
• Learner signs and dates to confirm the record is a true and accurate account of the
assessment.
