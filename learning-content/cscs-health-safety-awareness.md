## Introduction to Construction Health & Safety

Construction work is one of the most hazardous industries in the UK, with thousands of accidents occurring each year. The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 (CDM 2015) place legal duties on all parties involved in construction projects to ensure health and safety.

### Key Statistics
- Construction accounts for 5% of UK workforce but 30% of workplace fatalities
- Most accidents are preventable through proper planning and risk assessment
- Slips, trips, and falls are the most common cause of injury
- Working at height remains the biggest cause of fatal accidents

## Legal Framework

### Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
The primary legislation governing workplace health and safety in the UK. Key principles:
- Employers must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of employees
- Employees must take reasonable care of their own health and safety
- Employees must cooperate with employers on health and safety matters

### Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015
CDM 2015 applies to all construction projects and places duties on:
- **Clients** - Must ensure adequate arrangements for managing projects
- **Principal Designers** - Must plan, manage and monitor pre-construction phase
- **Principal Contractors** - Must plan, manage and monitor construction phase
- **Contractors** - Must plan, manage and monitor their own work
- **Workers** - Must be consulted on health and safety matters

## Common Construction Hazards

### 1. Working at Height
**Hazards:**
- Falls from ladders, scaffolds, and platforms
- Falling objects
- Unstable working surfaces

**Control Measures:**
- Use appropriate access equipment
- Ensure guardrails and toe boards are in place
- Use fall arrest systems where necessary
- Regular inspection of equipment
- Proper training for all workers

### 2. Manual Handling
**Hazards:**
- Musculoskeletal injuries
- Back strain and injury
- Cuts and bruises

**Control Measures:**
- Use mechanical aids where possible
- Team lifting for heavy items
- Proper lifting techniques
- Regular breaks and rotation of tasks
- Training in safe handling techniques

### 3. Hazardous Substances
**Hazards:**
- Asbestos exposure
- Dust inhalation
- Chemical burns

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

### Hierarchy of Control
1. **Elimination** - Remove the hazard completely
2. **Substitution** - Replace with less hazardous alternative
3. **Engineering Controls** - Isolate people from the hazard
4. **Administrative Controls** - Change work practices
5. **PPE** - Personal protective equipment (last resort)

### Types of PPE

#### Head Protection
- **Hard hats** - Must be worn on all construction sites
- **Bump caps** - For areas with low headroom
- Regular inspection and replacement when damaged

#### Eye and Face Protection
- **Safety glasses** - For general eye protection
- **Goggles** - For chemical splash protection
- **Face shields** - For grinding and cutting operations

#### Respiratory Protection
- **Dust masks** - For light dust exposure
- **Half-face respirators** - For moderate exposure
- **Full-face respirators** - For high exposure situations
- **Air-fed respirators** - For very high exposure

#### Hand Protection
- **General purpose gloves** - For handling materials
- **Cut-resistant gloves** - For sharp objects
- **Chemical-resistant gloves** - For hazardous substances
- **Anti-vibration gloves** - For vibrating tools

#### Foot Protection
- **Safety boots** - With steel toe caps
- **Waterproof boots** - For wet conditions
- **Anti-slip soles** - For slippery surfaces
- **Metatarsal guards** - For heavy objects

## Risk Assessment Process

### Five Steps to Risk Assessment

1. **Identify the Hazards**
   - Walk around the workplace
   - Look at accident records
   - Consider non-routine operations
   - Think about long-term health effects

2. **Decide Who Might Be Harmed**
   - Workers directly involved
   - Other workers on site
   - Members of the public
   - Vulnerable workers (young, pregnant, disabled)

3. **Evaluate the Risks**
   - Likelihood of harm occurring
   - Severity of potential harm
   - Existing control measures
   - Risk rating (High/Medium/Low)

4. **Record Your Findings**
   - Significant findings must be recorded
   - Include control measures
   - Review and update regularly
   - Make available to workers

5. **Review and Update**
   - Regular review of assessments
   - Update when circumstances change
   - Learn from accidents and incidents
   - Continuous improvement

## Emergency Procedures

### Fire Safety
- **Fire triangle** - Fuel, oxygen, heat
- **Fire prevention** - Good housekeeping, no smoking
- **Fire detection** - Smoke alarms, heat detectors
- **Fire fighting** - Appropriate extinguishers
- **Evacuation** - Clear routes, assembly points

### First Aid
- **First aiders** - Trained personnel on site
- **First aid boxes** - Well-stocked and accessible
