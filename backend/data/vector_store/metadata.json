Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 9 of 50 HEAL TH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is designed to protect people and the environment from workplace activities. It places certain duties and responsibilities on employers, employees, self-employed, designers and manufactures. Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 10 of 50 Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 11 of 50 PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULA TIONS 1998 (PUWER 98 ) Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide. Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 12 of 50 Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling objects. Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced.

Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the minimum you must do is: \u25cf Identify what could cause injury or illness in your business (hazards) \u25cf Decide how likely it is that someone could be harmed and how seriously (the risk) Take action to eliminate the hazard, or if this isn't possible, control the risk. The purpose of a Method Statement when on site is to document given specific instructions on how to SAFELY perform a work-related task. It is the plant operator\u2019s responsibility to COMPLY with the Method Statement. Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 13 of 50 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES In general plant operators are regarded as \u2018safety-critical\u2019 workers, which means their actions with the machine can have significant health & safety consequences for themselves and others. It is essential that all personnel involved in the planning, supervision and carrying out of mobile plant operations are adequately trained and competent for their role.

Hydraulic System Always ensure the filler cap area is clean and pressure in the system is released before removing the cap. Always use a clean container when filling the system to prevent contamination. Fuel System Where possible, plant should be filled up at the end of your shift to prevent condensation building up in the tank. Cooling System Cooling systems are normally pressurised and removing the cap can allow hot water to escape with the potential for causing SEVERE burns. Roll Over Protective Structure ROPS provides some protection to the operating position (as far as is reasonably practicable) in the event of an overturn. Falling Object Protective Structures Where there is the risk of people operating mobile work equipment being struck by falling material, falling object protective structures (FOPS) or a manufacturer\u2019s strengthened cab must be fitted to stop any falling material Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 19 of 50 striking the operator. When sitting in an enclosed cab that meets FOPS criteria, a hard hat does not need to be worn. Restraining Systems Seat belts must be worn even when the cab door is closed. This is because in the event of a roll over (as far as reasonably practical), it will keep the operator within the confines of the operating seat which may minimise injury. Tyres Raised lugs on tyres provide traction / grip for moving, steering and braking in soft mud. If tyres are worn, traction and grip will be severely affected.

As dumpers are not specifically designed for towing purposes, other methods should be explored before deciding on this purpose. Towing with a dumper requires enhanced training, in addition to the training delivered within the Skills Bootcamp programme. To assist with your knowledge and understanding of this \u2018safety critical\u2019 activity, below outlines some key safety information when towing with a dumper. Should you be asked to tow equipment, you must consider the following points: \u2714 All options have been considered and there no other more suitable machine is available. \u2714 Towing activities are authorised by the manufacturer of the dumper to be used. \u2714 The equipment to be towed does not exceed the specification set by the manufacturer in terms of the weight of the equipment and the downward load imposed on the towing point. \u2714 The towing bracket is compatible with the towing eye on the equipment to be towed. \u2714 You have been trained and are competent to carry out towing activities. \u2714 The correct towing pin for the towing bracket is used and that the safety pin is located correctly in the towing pin. \u2714 Towing balls come in a variety of sizes and where the size of ball differs from the towed equipment\u2019s towing hitch, there is a danger that the hitch can dislodge from the ball and the towed equipment become detached from the dumper. \u2714 The manufacturers handbook should be consulted to ensure a full understanding of the towing restrictions placed by the manufacturer. It should be noted that manufacturers requirements differ between different models from the same manufacturer. \u2714 The towing ability of the dumper may depend on whether the trailer is fitted with an overrun brake or is non-braked. Using an overweight non-braked trailer could cause loss of control during the braking activity.

The Health and Safety Executive publication \u2018Avoiding danger from overhead power lines\u2019 (GS6) gives valuable information and guidance on how to safely plan and set up work near to overhead power lines. High voltage electricity can arc across large gaps in certain conditions. OPERA TING IN CONFINED AREAS Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 33 of 50 Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 34 of 50 The Spillard Human Detection System identifies only human form through deep intelligent mapping. It aims to: \u2714 Warn operators and pedestrians of potential risks of collision. \u2714 Improve operators all around awareness of their surroundings. \u2714 Detect human form whilst ignoring ever changing backgrounds. \u2714 Reduce risk whilst improving the operator and pedestrian interaction. The human detection system is an aid to safety only. It must be used in addition to the site\u2019s safe system of work. Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 35 of 50 Safety Shield AI Collision Avoidance Technology Safety Shield is an advanced AI human form recognition safety system. The system cleverly integrates AI human form recognition (HFR) with strategically placed HD cameras. The in-cab LED visual and audio alert warns the driver of a pedestrian in proximity. An additional module can be fitted for an external alarm and Digital Thumbs Up LED display to allow site personal to approach the machine safely and from the correct direction. The Safety Shield system scans and detects all objects around it, but the smart technology will only alert the operator to pedestrians and vulnerable site personnel entering the danger recognition zones. By filtering out objects other than humans, the Safety Shield system reduces unnecessary distractions for the plant operator. Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 36 of 50 CONDUCT ALL NECESSAR Y SAFETY CHECKS AT THE LOADING AND DISCHARGING AREA Prior to setting up for work, the operator must conduct safety checks at the work area to identify any potential hazards.

Overloading obscures the operator\u2019s view and significantly reduces visibility. This increases the hazards associated with the people, plant interface. It is the dumper operator responsibility to determine maximum load. Always refer to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. LOADING, TRANSPORTING AND DISCHARGING DIFFERENT MATERIALS Denser materials: may overload your tyres and may stick to the body when tipping. You may need to tip at different locations. Semi-Fluid materials: may spill during travel. Spoil: this material should be segregated for re-use on or off-site, where possible. It must be placed a minimum distance of the depth of the trench away from the excavation to prevent collapse. Learner Workbook FTD v4 June25 Page 38 of 50 DISCHARGING LOADS A banksman should be used if deemed necessary in the risk assessment. Cameras are there as a visual aid when approaching the tipping area / stop block. Stop blocks are used to indicate the stopping point of the dumper and to prevent the machine from overrunning into the trench.
