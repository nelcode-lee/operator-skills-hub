OperateSAFE is an example of a company wide Health &\nSafety campaign which is championed by Flannery Plant Hire. It is a\ncampaign aimed at driving health and safety awareness and\nengagement across the business and industry wide. Other companies\nwill champion their own internal and external health and safety\ncampaigns which we encourage you to familiarize yourself with when\nstarting at a new job.\nThe OperateSAFE safety reminders throughout the workbook aim to\nhighlight key safety messages to our learners. Scan the QR code\nhere to view the OperateSafe introduction video.\nLITERACY – NUMERACY – ICT\nEnglish, Mathematics and ICT are embedded into\nthe content. You will be required to extract\ninformation from the operator manual, conduct\nsimple calculations of bucket capacities and read\ndigital screens in the cab of the machine or using\none of our training simulators.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE FORWARD\nTIPPING DUMPER\nA Forward Tipping Dumper (FTD) is commonly\nused on construction sites. It is used to transport\nlarge quantities of materials across a site, usually on rough,\nundulating terrain. Its ability to handle a mixture of terrain and\ncarry large loads makes it a flexible piece of equipment. This\ncourse will equip you with the knowledge, skills and\nconfidence to operate the machine safely, protecting both you\nand those around you. This course offers two certificate\noptions: operating either a tracked or wheeled machine\ndepending on your needs.\nThe course objectives are as follows:\n(cid:0) Understand the relevant legislation relating to work\nactivities.\n(cid:0) Comply with the manufacturer's instructions, using the\noperator's handbook and other information sources.\n(cid:0) Identify the hazards associated with plant or machinery operations and put the\nappropriate control measures in place.\n(cid:0) Identify the machine components and operator controls.\n(cid:0) Perform pre-shift and operational checks.\n(cid:0) Prepare the forward tipping dumper for site and road travel.\nLearner Workbook FTD v4 June25",

As dumpers are not specifically designed for towing purposes, other methods\nshould be explored before deciding on this purpose.\nTowing with a dumper requires enhanced training, in addition to the training delivered within\nthe Skills Bootcamp programme. To assist with your knowledge and understanding of this\n‘safety critical’ activity, below outlines some key safety information when towing with a\ndumper.\nShould you be asked to tow equipment, you must consider the following points:\n✔ All options have been considered and there no other more suitable machine is\navailable.\n✔ Towing activities are authorised by the manufacturer of the dumper to be used.\n✔ The equipment to be towed does not exceed the specification set by the\nmanufacturer in terms of the weight of the equipment and the downward load\nimposed on the towing point.\n✔ The towing bracket is compatible with the towing eye on the equipment to be towed.\n✔ You have been trained and are competent to carry out towing activities.\n✔ The correct towing pin for the towing bracket is used and that the safety pin is located\ncorrectly in the towing pin.\n✔ Towing balls come in a variety of sizes and where the size of ball differs from the\ntowed equipment’s towing hitch, there is a danger that the hitch can dislodge from\nthe ball and the towed equipment become detached from the dumper.\n✔ The manufacturers handbook should be consulted to ensure a full understanding of\nthe towing restrictions placed by the manufacturer. It should be noted that\nmanufacturers requirements differ between different models from the same\nmanufacturer.\n✔ The towing ability of the dumper may depend on whether the trailer is fitted with an\noverrun brake or is non-braked. Using an overweight non-braked trailer could cause\nloss of control during the braking activity.\nLearner Workbook FTD v4 June25",

Falling Object Protective Structure - a safety feature built into the cab or\ncanopy of the machine designed to protect the operator from falling\nobjects, such as rocks, debris, or materials from above.\nLearner Workbook FTD v4 June25",

This involves adjusting the machine’s\ndirection, speed, or position for tasks.\nMaterial Handling Moving bulk materials, like soil, gravel, or sand, from one place to another.\nMuck Shifting The process of moving large volumes of earth or spoil from one area of a\nsite to another.\nOscillating To move repeatedly from side to side or up and down between two points.\nOverloaded The machine carries more weight than its maximum safe payload, risking\ndamage and unsafe operation.\nPeople, Plant Interface The interaction between workers (people) and machinery (plant).\nPressurised If a container, etc. is pressurised, the air pressure inside it is higher than\nthe air pressure outside it.\nRear Axle Located at the back of the vehicle, the rear axle supports the rear wheels,\ncarries part of the load’s weight, and provides drive power to help propel\nthe dumper across the site.\nRed Zone Area around the machine that is high-risk.\nRestraining Systems Seat belt.\nReversing Alarm A loud alert sound to warn others when the machine is reversing.\nRisk Assessment The process of identifying hazards in the workplace.\nR.O.P.S. Rollover Protective Structure – a safety feature in cabs to protect the\noperator in case of a rollover.\nRotating Seat Dumper A type of forward tipping dumper where the operator’s seat and controls\ncan rotate.\nSafety Critical Actions with the machine can have significant health & safety\nconsequences.\nLearner Workbook FTD v4 June25",
