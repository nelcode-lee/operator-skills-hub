🚀 Next Steps Recommendation
IMMEDIATE ACTION: Focus on completing the student learning system as it's the core user-facing functionality. The AI system and instructor tools are already working well, but students need a complete learning experience.
Would you like me to:
Start implementing the Universal Content Viewer for PDF, video, and image content?
Complete the Knowledge Test System with the interactive interface?
Build the Student Enrollment API for course catalog functionality?
Focus on a specific component you'd like to prioritize?
The foundation is solid - we just need to complete the student-facing features to have a fully functional learning management system!
